  description: "The following survey has statements that you will respond to with your level of agreement. As you read the sentence, you will know whether you agree or disagree. Fill in the circle that describes how much you agree or disagree. Even though some statements are very similar, please answer each statement. This is not timed; work fast, but carefully. There are no \"right\" or \"wrong\" answers! The only correct responses are those that are true for you.",
